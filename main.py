"""
Module Dependencies:
- cv2: OpenCV, a popular computer vision library for image and video processing.
- zero_shot_emotior: The ZeroShotEmotior class for zero-shot emotion detection.

Code Explanation:
- The code defines a main function that runs real-time zero-shot emotion detection using the ZeroShotEmotior class and OpenCV.
- The main function captures video frames from the default camera (index 0) using the cv2.VideoCapture class.
- For each frame, the ZeroShotEmotior class is used to perform zero-shot emotion detection and obtain the annotated frame.
- The annotated frame is displayed using the cv2.imshow function.
- The while loop continues until the user presses the 'q' key to exit.
- The video_capture is released and windows are destroyed after the loop ends.

Note:
- The code assumes that OpenCV (cv2) and the ZeroShotEmotior class are properly installed and imported before running the script.
- Ensure that the camera is properly connected and accessible by OpenCV.
- Customize the ZeroShotEmotior class and its dependencies according to your specific implementation.
