Python code for zero-shot image classification using the CLIP model from the Transformers library.
"""

from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForZeroShotImageClassification

# Load the CLIP model and processor
checkpoint = "openai/clip-vit-large-patch14"
model = AutoModelForZeroShotImageClassification.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(checkpoint)

# Define candidate labels for image classification

"""
Module Dependencies:
- transformers: A powerful Python library for state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning models, including the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model.
"""

"""
Code Explanation:
- The code snippet imports the necessary modules from the Transformers library.
- It loads the pre-trained CLIP model for zero-shot image classification using the specified checkpoint ("openai/clip-vit-large-patch14").
- The AutoModelForZeroShotImageClassification class is used to instantiate the model, which can classify images based on arbitrary text descriptions.
- The pre-trained processor is loaded using the AutoProcessor class, enabling the model to process input images and text.
- The candidate_labels list is defined, specifying the potential classes for image classification.
"""

"""
Example Usage:
- With the model, processor, and candidate_labels defined, you can classify images by providing an image and a text description as input to the model.
- The model will predict the likelihood of the image belonging to each of the candidate labels.
- The candidate_labels list can be customized to match the specific classification task or domain.
